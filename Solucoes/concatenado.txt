Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn’t seen
When I’m feeling ordinary
When I don’t know what I mean

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

Saying it’s true
It’s not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
It’s a laugh that’s just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
Now you’ve got me open handed
Now you've got me lost for words

I sing oooh
Oooh
Oooh ooh
Oooh ooh

I sing oooh
Oooh
Oooh ooh
Oooh ooh

Oooh
Oooh
Oooh ooh
Oooh ooh

A head full of dreams

Oooh
Oooh
Oooh ooh

Into life I’ve just been woken
With a head full
A head full of dreamsTurn your magic on, umi, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on, umi, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape

(Woo)
(Woo)

If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through, oh

And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you
With you
With you

Say: Oh, say: Yeah

Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)We sat on a roof
Named every star
Shared every bruise and
Showed every scar

Hope has its proof
Put your hand in mine
Life has a beautiful, crazy design
And time seemed to say
Forget the world and its weight
Here I just wanna stay

Amazing day
Amazing day

We sat on a roof
Named every star and
You showed me a place
Where you can be what you are

And the view
The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I'm drifting away
And in your arms
I just wanna sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
Can there be breaks
In the chaos sometimes?
Oh, thanks God
Must've heard when I prayed
Cause now I always
Want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
TodayBeen around the world, wonders to view
Been around the world, looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, babylon too
But the beautiful-est treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I'll never say die, I'm never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is going to fight for you

Been around the world, universe too
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Dance with the stars, while I see the Moon
I'll be standing there besides you
Right when the storm comes through

'Cause I'll never say die, I'm never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is going to fight for you
My army of one is going to fall for you, yeah

'Cause you're right, 'cause you're right
'Cause you're right
My army of one is gonna call it through

Say my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
Is my only weapon, army of one
Say my heart is my gun, army of one

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

So I put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, it's all right
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been in a city but it centered around me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) yeah yeah wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) and I know, and I know, and I know
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got
X marks the spot
So I put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the price
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fly
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure, yeah yeah wherever you areBeen standing in the corner
Studying the lights
The dreaming of escaping
Will keep you up at night

But someone had put the flares up
And got me in rays
So I guess I better stay
Uh uh, no come on! You say

It's a fool's gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start
What if I won't see you again?

Around here you never want
To sleep all night
So start falling in love
Start the riot and

Come on rage with me
We don't need words
And we'll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography

Come on and raise it
Come on raise this noise
For the million people
Who got no one voice
Come on, it's not over!
If you mean it say loud
Come on all for love
Out from the underground

Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds
Flying free
Holding on in the mystery

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Fearless together oh oh oh oh oh oh

When you fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so coolThis being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes

As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house

Empty of its furniture
Still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out
For some new delight

The dark thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whatever comes
Because each has been sent
As a guide from beyondOh, they say people come
They say people go
This particular diamond
Was extra special

And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don’t slow?
When it feels like the end of my world

And I should, but I can't let it go

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we die

But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know you're always with me
And the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
'Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow

Oh, what I would give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow
So if you love someone
You should let them know
Oh, the light that you give me will everglowI know it's over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over
An ocean awaits for a storm
The Sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh oooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh, I-aaah
Now we're stopping the world, stopping it's spin
But come on don't give up
Don't say we give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Woo ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh ooh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

I know it's over
Before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
I know it's over
Icarus says to the Sun
The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
And two forces, two forces collide
And fight 'til it's over
Fight 'til it's done
Ah ah ah
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh oh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh, I-aaah
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping in its tracks but
Nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over
Before you run
Oh, didn't we have fun?

Cause you and me, we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me, we were always meant to
Always meant to be
Hey-ey-ey-ey

Wooh ooh ooh ooh oo ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh oh didn’t we have fun?
Wooh ooh ooh ooh oo ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh oh didn’t we have fun?

But then
Maybe we could againDrink from me, drink from me (I, oh, I, oh, I)
That I shoot across the symphony
That I shoot across the sky
Drink from me, drink from me (I, oh, I, oh, I)
That I shoot across the symphony
So high, so high
That I shoot across the sky

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up

Life is a drink and love’s a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said: Drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can’t get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I’m low, low, low, low

I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love’s about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I’m low, low, low, low

I, oh I, oh I
You got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

I, oh, I, oh, I
La la la la la la la
So high, so high

I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across theThis being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival

A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor

Welcome and entertain them all!
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guideFixing up a car, driving it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up
Up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood
It's in your blood

Underneath the storm, an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up
Up and up

It's saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the Moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle?
How come people break your heart?
Break your heart

Yes, I wanna grow, yes, I want to feel
Yes, I wanna know
Show me how to heal it up
Heal it up

See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love
Just need love

When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up

(Believe in love)
